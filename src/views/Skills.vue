                        Nice to e-meet you guys here, on my site. Please get awareness with a big part of my
                        life, but I have to admit this page isn't formal and so rigorous I just take this opportunity to
                        share my thoughts about different spheres of study and work. So my name is Romanna, but I prefer
                        a more friendly name - just Roma. So if you are interested please keep read this. If you have
                        question you can always write an email or make a call. Or if you have some proposals for me I
                        would
                        greatly appreciate your kindly on this.

                            <p>I work as an engineer for quality assurance for almost 3 years. I love my work so much,
                                but at the same time, progress is needed. And I found it interesting to know deeper how
                                it works behind the scene. I have obtained a basic knowledge in the university but it's
                                a so little piece in this world of programming. So I started from the HTML and CSS. The
                                further the more interesting. JavaScript became my first strong language (despite on a
                                couple of lessons of C++ in the first curses of the university). You may ask "why
                                front-end" - my answer will be - it's exciting, and you always can see the result on the
                                browser. Moreover - all people over the world could see what you made, isn't pleasure? I
                                believe it is. Please find below a list of duties that I do every day.</p>

                            <p>My master degree is about project management. To be honest I obtained the real conception
                                of project management on the real tasks. There is no better thing than to see it and try
                                by myself. On my working project, I have an opportunity to try myself in this area, to
                                speak with colleges how to do something, make decisions, taking into account the risks
                                and transfer all that stuff to the customer - it's a specific science. So please find
                                below a list of my skills and knowledge which are acquired on the study and at the work:

                                was foundations and some of the technologies are very old for now. Anyway, it was a
                                great experience to cognize something new after school and become a person who heard
                                about all things related to IT and could understand the essence. Below you can find a
